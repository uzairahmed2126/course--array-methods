# The `includes()` method of String values performs a case-sensitive search to determine whether a given string may be found within this string, returning true or false as appropriate.


## Syntax
```
includes(searchString)
includes(searchString, position)


```

```javascript
console.log(str.includes('c', 3)); //it is false becuase the index of c is 2 and the position is 3 and 3 is greater than the given index.
console.log(str.indexOf('c')); //2
```
