# matchAll() in JavaScript for strings finds all matches of a regular expression, including capturing groups, and returns an iterator with the results.

## Syntax
```
match(regexp)

```

```javascript
const paragraph = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. It barked.';
const regex = /[A-Z]/g;
const found = paragraph.matchAll(regex);
console.log(...found);
```
## output
```
[
  'T',
  index: 0,
  input: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. It barked.',
  groups: undefined
] [
  'I',
  index: 45,
  input: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. It barked.',
  groups: undefined
]
```
